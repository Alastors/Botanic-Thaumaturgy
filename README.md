# Botanic Thaumaturgy
Botanic Thaumaturgy is yet another addon for thaumcraft 4 by Alastor
   
This mod is forged in the hellfires of spite.

Again, just like in Thaumic Insurgence I'd also like to take this line to extend my thanks to the Arcana team for their lovely textures and just amazing mod in general, thank you Arcana Dev Team for allowing the use of Arcana assets except the lore!
Specificially thank you to Ibanplay for the lovely textures! Thank you for the good work sir!
